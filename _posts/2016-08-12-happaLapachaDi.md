*paapad sidedish*


I have finally decided to move out of my inertia and dust my long forgotten blog. Today for lunch I made a really simple konakni fare. I made this happaLa pachaDi to go with rice and saru.
These spicy happaLs are a must in every konkani household (red pappad - though the translation is not accurate). I am hoping to make these happaLs someday and post that recipe too.
I dont like eating happaLs for every meal like some konkani people do, but every now and then  I do long to eat them.

**Ingredients**

* Grated coconut - about 3 tablespoons
* Onion cut into small pieces - about 1 tablespoon
* Green chilles - 1
* Roasted happaL - 2


**Method**

* Mix the coconut, onions and green chillies beforehand.
* Add the crushed happal just before serving
* You can adjust the proportion of the above ingredients as per your taste and preference. There is no need to add salt as happaL already is salty.

Preparation time: 5 minutes
