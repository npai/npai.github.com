_prawns sidedish_

Most of the people who eat non-veg love prawns and there are many prawn delicacies to choose from. I made this khoLu yesterday especially for my husband who loves prawns. 
khoLu in Konkani  means the liquid part of the pickle. Though this item does not taste like pickle, I guess it infers its name from the _amshe_, _miTshe_, _thikshe_  (sour,salty and spicy) tastes. This is also extremely easy to make.

_Ingredients_

* Cleaned prawns - 1 cup
* Onions cut into small pieces - 1 cup
* Green chillies - 2 to 3
* Chilli powder - 3 teaspoons
* Tamarind extract - made from a lemon sized ball
* Oil
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* In a kadai heat some oil and add the onion pieces and green chillies. Fry for a few minutes on a low flame.
* Now add the prawns to this, add a little salt and fry till the prawns start looking solid and white.
* At this stage, add a little water, close the vessel with a lid and cook for 5-6 minutes to ensure that the prawns are cooked.
* In a separate bowl, mix the tamarind extract, chilli powder and some salt. You can vary the proportion of the tamarind and chilli powder to suit your taste.
* Add this mixture to the onions and prawns, add some water and see if the proportion of the salt and tamarind is fine. Do not add a lot of water. Allow it to boil well and then simmer for another 5-6 minutes. By the end of this, you will be getting a yummy smelling flavour :)

Serve with rice as a sidedish or with chapatis, bread etc.
