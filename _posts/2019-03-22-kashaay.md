*Spiced beverage*

In most konkani households it is customary to offer guests the choice of kashaay as a beverage along with tea or coffee. The kashaya piTTo (powder) is usually made and stocked in airtight containers for a few months at a time. The base ingredients are coriander seeds and jeera and some saunf. Other ingredients like pepper or methi can also be added according to individual taste. I like the taste of saunf and hence I add it generously. This kashaya has a soothing effect on the body and also aids in digestion and needless to add it tastes yummy. People prefer to drink this over tea or coffee especially in the evenings.
