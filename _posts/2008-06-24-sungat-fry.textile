_shrimp fry_

I love fish but my husband likes shrimp. So I make shrimp dishes regularly. It is also so much easier to make. Especially this shrimp fry will go with rice and any gravy/daal. 

You can use both fresh or frozen shrimp for this. Just clean the shrimp by removing the outer cover (shell) and wash it.
