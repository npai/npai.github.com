_idli vada_


This sunday my MIL and I made an elaborate-Sunday-breakfast :) comprising
of idli, vada, sambhar and chutney... and ofcourse tea.Earlier, I was never fond of
idlis made at home because they would somehow come out very hard and tasteless.
But I particularly like the idlis made by my MIL... they are very soft, fluffy and yummy.
So I thought of sharing this recipe with other idli-newbies

_idli_

Many people use Idli rava (rice sooji) for making idlis. But in this
method rice is used directly.

_Ingredients_
* Urad dal - 3/4th cup
* Rice - 2 cups
* Poha/puffed rice - 1/4th cup
* A pinch of salt
* Baking soda


_Method_

* Soak rice and daal in separate containers for 4-5 hours (preferably previous afternoon)
* Just 15 minutes before grinding, soak poha.
* Grind the urad daal to a very smooth batter (Do not add too much water, just add as much as needed).Set this aside.
* Now grind the rice and poha. Again dont add more water. Grind this till you get a very fine rava-like consistency
of the rice in the batter.
* Now mix the 2 batters, add some salt and keep the batter overnight in a warm place.(Take care to use a big container here
as the volume of the batter increases after fermentation)
* In the morning add a little baking soda 15 mins before cooking. 
* Grease the idli-stand with a little oil and steam the idlis for about 15 minutes. Open the idli cooker after 5-10 mins and
the idlis are ready !!!

Preparation time: 30 minutes + Leave overnight 
Cooking time:  20 minutes


_vada_

Idli seems somewhat incomplete without the thoot-vada (vada with hole) 
and so here is the recipe.

_Ingredients_
* Urad dal - 1 cup
* Green chillies - 2
* Ginger - half an inch
* Pepper - 4 to 5 grains
* Small and thin slices of coconut - about 10
* Salt
* Baking soda
* Oil for frying


_Method_

* Soak urad daal for 2 hours and grind it to a very smooth and thick batter. Add water just enough for the mixer.
* Grind ginger, chillies and pepper to a coarse mixture and add it to the batter.
* Also add the coconut pieces,salt to taste and a little baking soda.
* Take some of this batter on your left palm and make a small hole in the centre and carefully place it in the kadai
with hot oil.
* Deep fry on a low flame till a reddish brown colour is reached.

Preparation time: 20 minutes 
Cooking time:  5 minutes

_sambhar_

I use bisibele-bhat powder for making this particular sambhar. However any of the regular/homemade sambhar powder
can be used for the purpose

_Ingredients_
* Toor dal - 1 cup
* Onion - 1
* Tomatoes - 2
* Bisibele-bhat powder/sambhar powder - 3 teaspoons
* Green chillies - 2
* Red chillies - 2
* Curry leaves 
* Coriander leaves
* Mustard - 1 teaspoon
* A pinch of hing/asafoetida
* Oil for seasoning


_Method_

* Cut tomatoes,onions and green chillies to small pieces and pressure cook with toor daal.
* Now add sambhar powder, finely chopped coriander leaves, salt to taste and bring to boil. Simmer for a few minutes.
* Now for seasoning heat a little oil and add mustard. After it stops sputtering, add red chillies, hing and curry leaves in 

that order and pour it over the sambhar.


Time : 30 minutes 

_chutney_

I am sure that there is no need to write about the method for making chutney. But even then I am 
writing it to make the article complete.

_Ingredients_
* grated coconut - 1 cup
* Green chillies - 3
* Tamarind - 
* Red chillies - 2
* Curry leaves 
* Mustard - 1 teaspoon
* Oil for seasoning


_Method_

* Fry green chillies with a little oil.
* Grind coconut,green chillies, a little tamarind and salt with the required amount of water.
* For seasoning heat a little oil and add mustard. After it stops sputtering, add red chillies and curry leaves in that order 

and pour it over the sambhar.


Time : 10 minutes
