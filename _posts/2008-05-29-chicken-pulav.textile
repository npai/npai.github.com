Last weekend we had a late breakfast and till 2 0' clock I hadnt thought about what to cook for lunch. But then we were very hungry and I made this quick chicken pulav. It is a recipe from my father's very close friend. Uncle S had once cooked this Chicken pulav and invited us for dinner when his wife was away. It gets ready in 20 minutes and is yummy.
