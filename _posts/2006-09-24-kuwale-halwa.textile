_ashgourd halwa_

<a href="http://www.hindu.com/seta/2005/07/07/stories/2005070700141700.htm">Ashgourd/white pumpkin/Winter melon </a> 
is very good for health and has a cooling effect on the body. I especially like the Damroot and Pheta sweets made out of it but I feel taht it may be tedious to make them at home. So I prefer to cook this halwa at home. It is also widely used in making sambhars.

_Ingredients_
* Grated ashgourd - 2 cups
* Sugar - 3/4 cup
* Ghee - 2 tablespoons
* Cardmom/Elaichi
* Cashew

_Method_

* Cook the grated ashgourd in a wide bottomd pan. Do not add any water as it discharges water on its own. It will take about 20 minutes to become soft.
* Now add sugar and cook again for a few minutes on a low flame.
* Add some ghee, elaichi powder and garnish with cashewnuts.

Time required:  40 minutes
