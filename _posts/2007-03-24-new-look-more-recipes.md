I usually do a lot of experimental cooking but never bothered to write about them in this blog as I wanted to write mostly about konkani food. But isnt it good to drift now and then from the main theme? And again this would be the best source if I want to look up the recipe which I had conjured up. To begin with, I posted the
<a href="http://konkanirecipes.com/recipes/crispy-bhindi-fry"> bhindi-fry </a>   recipe and from now on I definitely will be posting most of the recipes I try out :) And to keep up this spirit I have given a new look to this site. Hope you all like it.
