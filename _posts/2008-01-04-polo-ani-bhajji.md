_dosa with curry_

Dosas are the most common breakfast items in konkani households. But it doesnt get boring as there are a lot of varieties of dosas to choose from. One such dosa is this 'Urid maida polo'. I havent eaten this dosa in any other place or hotels apart from konkani households. It can be served with coconut chutney (again there are different chutney variations). But I like this particular potato and onion curry with this dosa.

_Urid maida poLo_

One advantage of this dosa is that it doesnt require fermentation and can be made instantly.

_Ingredients_

* Urid daal - 1 cup
* Maida flour (all purpose flour) - 4 cups
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* Soak the urid daal in water for one hour (even 30 mins would suffice) and grind it to a smooth batter. You can prepare upto this stage the previous evening and then refrigerate this batter. Or you can also make this  batter in the morning.
* Now in a separate vessel mix the maida with cold water and make a thin paste. Add some salt. Mix it thoroughly to remove any lumps. Do not add a lot of water.
* Finally mix the maida and the urid batter and make thin dosas out of it.

Preparation time: 1 hour
