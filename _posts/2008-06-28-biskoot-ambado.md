_vada_

I made this biskooT ambaDo with aalle(ginger) chutney for today's evening tea. The konkani biskooT ambaDo is nothing but the regular 'uddina vada'. I dont know why it is called biskooT ambaDo :-) 

There is an unwritten rule that this ambaDo is to be accompanied by aalle chutney. It is very easy to make this vada. But you should plan atleast one hour before (in order to soak the urad daal)
