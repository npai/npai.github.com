_Radish fry_

The phodis are eaten as a side dish with rice and any curry. The phodis can be made with virtually any kind of vegetable like potato, raw banana, brinjal,okra etc etc. Earlier I had posted about <a href="http://konkanirecipes.com/recipes/bittergourd-fry"> bittergourd phodi </a>. Traditionally rava will be added to make the phodis crispy. But in this mulangi phodi I have not used rava. And believe me even people who dont like radish will love this phodi.
