_chakli_

I guess chakkuli/chaakli/chakkli needs no introduction. There are many ways of making chakklis. The conventional method of making chakklis is quite elaborate. However if you get a craving for chakklis, here is a method of making instant chakklis. I did not go to the trouble of making round shapely chakklis though, which saved me time all the more :)
