_spinach stir-fry_

I love most varities of Indian greens especially palak and methi. I like the stir-fry (upkaris) anyday better than the curries. This upkari is one of my favourites and goes great with any simple daal/rasam etc.

_Ingredients_

* Spinach (washed and chopped) - 2 cups
* Urad daal (black gram)- 1.5 teaspoons
* Onions(cut into small pieces) - 1 small size
* Grated coconut - 2 tablespoons
* Red chillies - 2 
* Oil
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* Heat some oil in a kadai and add the urad daal.
* When the urad daal starts to change colour, add the red chillies broken into 2 pieces each and onions.
* Fry for 5 mins on low flame and then add the spinach. Keep stirring on low flame.
* After 5 mins, add some salt and grated coconut. Cook on low flame stirring frequently. In another 5 mins, the upkari must be done. It will taste yummy.

Note: Do not add too much of salt. No water is required as palak + salt will discharge some water


Preparation time: 20 minutes
