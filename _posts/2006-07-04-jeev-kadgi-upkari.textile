_Breadfruit sidedish._


jeev kaDgi is yet another favourite vegetable for the konkanis.  I just came to know that it is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadfruit" title="Breadfruit">Breadfruit</a> in English. A variety of dishes are made with this jeev kaDgi and I hope to blog sometime about all of them.

_Ingredients_
* 1 medium sized jeev kaDgi
* Green chillies - 4
* Mustard - 1 teaspoon
* Grated coconut - 3 tablespoons
* Oil for seasoning
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* Peel the outer green skin of the breadfruit and cut into small pieces. 
* Heat oil in a kaDai. 
* Add mustard. After the mustard stops sputtering, add the green chillies slit into two.
* Now add the kaDgi pieces, salt to taste and fry on a small flame for a few minutes.
* Now add about half a cup of water (add more water if it is not enough), close the lid and cook the upkari till the water evaporates and the kaDgi is cooked.
* Finally garnish with grated coconut.

_Tips_
* Be sure to coat your hands and the knife with edible oil before cutting the kaDgi.
* You can put these pieces into water if you are not going to cook immediately to prevent the blackening (like potato)
