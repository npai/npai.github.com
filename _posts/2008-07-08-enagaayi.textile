_eggplant sidedish_

eNagaayi means eNNe (oil) + kaayi (vegetable). The eggplants are fried in oil and then the masala is added. The tiniest variety of the eggplants must be used for this eNagaayi.

eNagaayi is very popular and commonly made in North karnataka belt of Hubli, Dharwad, Bijapur etc It is made as a sidedish with joLada rotti. (jowar rotti)

There are lots of versions of this eNagaayi. This is my MIL's recipe and I like it a lot. She makes it usually for dinner along with chapati or akki-rotti.

The eggplants must be carefully chosen for this dish and then 4 cuts must be made into it from the bottom, with the crown of the eggplant  being kept intact. The cuts are needed to allow the eggplant to cook well.
