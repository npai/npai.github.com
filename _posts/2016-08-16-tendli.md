*ivygourd sidedish*

Tendli is one of the favourite veggies at home. It is liked in all forms and as such I make different dishes with it. I had posted a similar recipe
[years ago](http://www.konkanirecipes.com/tendli-talasani) . Though the ingredients are exactly the same, it tastes different because of the way the tenDli is crushed here and not cut.
Bits of each tenDli's small ends are cut and then each tenDli is crushed with a small stone (or in a mortar). The trick is to do enough damage
to each tendli so that it has some slits on it but it still remains as a single piece :). All the masalas get into the slits and also the cooking
time is fast. I use coconut oil for this recipe. But you can choose any oil.
