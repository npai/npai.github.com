_karate phoDi_


Unlike most people I really love karate. My mother was with me this weekend and I asked her to make karate fry for me. It tastes yummy with rice and daal or any other curry.

_Ingredients_
* 2 Bittergourds ( cut into long slices)
* Red chilli powder
* Tamarind pulp
* Salt
* Rava - 1 teaspoon
* Oil for frying

_Method_

* Apply salt to the karela and set aside for atleast one hour. The longer you marinate, the less bitter it will be.
* Drain all the salt water from the karela pieces by taking a handful and squeezing tightly.
* To this apply the tamarind pulp, red chilli powder and rava.
* Shallow fry on a tava on a small flame with sufficient amount of oil.
