<i>Crab Curry</i>

I was not a big fan of crab when I was grwoing up. But now I like it a lot and so does the kid. When it comes to seafood
I am very picky and like only the traditional konkani preparation. This is my mother's recipe for kurle ambat. I have no idea 
how to clean the crab. I get the cooked snow crab clusters, break them into small pieces and use in my preparation.

Here is a step by step prepartion of the crab curry. If you are using fresh raw crab, then you will have to clean it before using in the curry.
