<i>Crab Curry</i>

I was not a big fan of crab when I was growing up. But now I like it a lot and so does the kid. When it comes to seafood, I am very picky and like only the traditional konkani preparation. This is my mother's recipe for kurle ambat. I have no idea how to clean the crab. I get the cooked snow crab clusters, break them into small pieces and use in my preparation. 

Here is a step by step prepartion of the crab curry. If you are using fresh raw crab, then you will have to clean it before using in the curry.

_Ingredients_

* Cooked snowcrab - 2 
* Chopped onion - 1 big or 2 small
* Green chillies (optional) - 2
* Grated coconut - 3/4th cup
* Tamarind - a small marble sized
* Coriander seeds - 1.5 teaspoons
* Turmeric - A pinch
* Red chilles - 5 to 6
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* Cut the crab into pieces (I cut the frozen and cooked snow crab).
* Add the chopped onions, green chillies, some water and salt to it and boil. This step didnt take more than 5 minutes long for 
  me as the crab was already cooked.
* Meanwhile dry roast the coriander seeds and red chillies. The crab curry is usually made less on the spicy side because the
  crab meat is sweet.
* Grind the roasted mixture with coconut, tamarind and turmeric powder to a smooth paste.
* Once the crab and onion mixture is cooked, add this ground paste to it and give a good boil.
* Crab curry is ready to be savored with rice.
