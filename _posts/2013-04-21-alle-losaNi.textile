alle means ginger and losaNi is garlic in konkani. I dont know the origin of this recipe nor have I eaten this anywhere else other than my home. I grew up knowing this as one of my father's comfort food. This is a very easy to make affair and is simply lots of cut ginger and garlic fried in ghee and seasoned with black pepper and salt. When this is mixed with steaming hot rice and eaten, it is heavenly and very satisfying not to mention the health benefits of all the ingredients. It is especially good in winters.
