_okra sidedish_

I had eaten this bhenDekaayi-gojju a couple of times at my  friends' places in Bangalore and liked it a lot. Then I asked my friends Savitha and Ashwini for the recipe. Both of them gave a slightly different recipe. So I came up with my own slightly tweaked version combining those two. I like okra in most forms and so I always have some in the fridge. I make this gojju along with Rasam usually. First we have rice with the gojju and then with rasam.
