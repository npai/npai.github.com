<i>paapad sidedish/i>


I have finally decided to move out of my inertia and dust my long forgotten blog. Today for lunch I made a really simple konakni fare. I made this happaLa pachaDi to go with rice and saru.
These spicy happaLs are a must in every konkani household (red pappad - though the translation is not accurate). I am hoping to make these happaLs someday and post that recipe too.
I dont like eating happaLs for every meal like some konakni people do, but every now and then  I do long to eat them.
