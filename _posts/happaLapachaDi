<i>paapad sidedish/i>


I have finally decided to move out of my inertia and dust my long forgotten blog. Today for lunch I made a really simple konakni fare. I made this happaLa pachaDi to go with rice and saru.
These spicy happaLs are a must in every konkani household (red pappad - though the translation is not accurate). I am hoping to make these happaLs someday and post that recipe too.
I dont like eating happaLs for every meal like some konkani people do, but every now and then  I do long to eat them.

_Ingredients_

* Grated coconut - about 3 tablespoons
* Onion cut into small pieces - about 1 tablespoon
* Green chilles - 1
* Grated coconut - 3/4th cup
* Roasted happaL - 2


_Method_

* Mix the coconut, onions and green chillies beforehand.
* Add the chopped onions, green chillies, some water and salt to it and boil. This step didnt take more than 5 minutes long for me as the crab was already cooked.
* You can adjust the proportion of the above ingredients as per your taste and preference. There is no need to add salk as happaL already is salty.
 
Preparation time: 5 minutes
