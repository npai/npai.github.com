_Ingredients_

( Serves 4-5 people)
* Rice – 4 cups
* Grated coconut– 1 cup
* Parched Rice (poha) - half cup  		
* Grated Jaggery - half cup
* Fenugreek seeds (methi) - 2 teaspoons
* Cucumber - 1
* Turmeric powder
* Salt to taste
* Cardamom

_Method_

* Soak the rice and the fenugreek seeds in a container with just enough water to cover for an hour.
* In a separate bowl, soak the parched rice for 15 minutes (with very little water)
* Peel the cucumber and cut into small pieces.		
* Now grind together the rice, parched rice and cucumber pieces. Do not add water (the cucumber juice should suffice).
The batter should be roughly as thick as idly batter.
* To this batter, add jaggery, a pinch of turmeric, cardmom powder and salt to taste.
* Leave the batter overnight. Do not refrigerate.
* In the morning, prepare thick dosas (do not spread). The dosas will turn out very fluffy. Serve hot with ghee or butter.

_Tips_

* Puffed rice can be used instead of parched rice.
* If cucumber is not available, use more coconut.

Preparation time: 1 hour , soak overnight
