I have chosen BangDa (Mackerel). However the method is the same for any fish.

_Ingredients_

For the roti 

* Fish Pieces (Cleaned and cut) - 10
* Rava - 1 cup
* Tamarind - size of a lemon
* Chilli powder - 4 tablespoons
* Tumeric powder - half teaspoon
* Salt - To taste ( approx 2.5 teaspoons or more)
* Oil
    
_Method_

* Soak the tamarind in a little water.
* To this add the chilly powder, turmeric and salt and mix well. See if the salt is enough. ( After applying it to the raw fish, you may not feel like tasting it)
* Now apply the paste to all the sides of the fish pieces evenly. 
* Set aside the fish for atleast one hour so that it absorbs the flavour (refrigerate it to prevent from spoiling)
* Now roll each piece generously in rava on all sides.
* Use a a wide bottom pan for shallow fry. Fry with sufficient oil on a small flame till the fish turns crispy on all sides (approximately 20 to 25 minutes)
    
_Tips_

* The longer you marinate it, the better the fish will taste.
* For added flavour, add a few flakes of crushed garlic flakes to the masala.
