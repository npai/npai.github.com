_pathrode_

Pathrode is a konkani speciality dish. It is also made in other parts of India like Gujarath and Maharastra but the masala is different. Even in konkani households, the proportion of the spices and daals varies. Some people add some jaggery to give it a sweetish taste. But I have always preferred the non-sweet version. 
Pathrode is made out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colocasia" title="Colocasia">Colocasia leaves (aLva paan)</a>. Some of the Colocasia leaves are itchy.. so you have to be a little careful when choosing the leaves. The tender ones are supposed to be non-itchy. Tamarind is always added more to any dishes with Colocasia to offset any itchiness. 

_Ingredients_

* Prepared colocasia leaves - 4-5
* Toor dal - 3 cups (or 2 cups Toor daal and 1 cup greengram )
* Rice - 2 cups
* Tamarind - lemon sized ball
* Hing/Asafoetida - 2 pinches
* Grated coconut - 1.5 to 2 cups
* Red chillies - 8 to 10


_Method_

* Prepare the leaves by washing thoroughly with water and trimming the thick veins on the back.

* Rub the paste on the back of one leaf, then layer the second leaf and rub more paste. Arrange about 4-5 leaves this way.

* Roll the layered leaves and steam it the way you would steam idlis. It will take 30-35 minutes to cook properly.

* Allow it to cook a little and cut the pathrode in small rings and serve by topping with a little coconut oil. It is yummylicious :)
