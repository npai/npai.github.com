_cold macaroni salad_

It is very hot in Bangalore nowadays. So I fixed this quick, cold, refreshing, tasty and definitely nutritious salad as an evening snack for us. The recipe was a figment of my imagination. It was a hit and I am planning to prepare again tomorrow ;) For this dish I have used MTR macaroni of different shapes, English mustard and Salad dressing  (as I had them in my fridge) for flavouring. I thought it was a good idea to put a picture of those as well. The only time consuming part of this dish is boiling the macaroni.

_Ingredients_

* Macaroni - 1 cup 
* Cucumber (cut into small pieces) - half cup
* Tomato (cut into small pieces) - 1
* Sweet corn - half cup
* Spring onion (finely cut) - a handful
* Vinegar
* English mustard - 2 teaspoons
* Salad dressing - 2 teaspoons
* Salt and pepper to taste


_Method_

* Boil the macaroni for a good 20 minutes, drain and set aside.
* In a large bowl, add the 2 sauces and vinegar and mix well.
* Now add all the other ingredients one by one and toss them.
* Add salt and pepper to taste and serve.

It would be a good idea to refrigerate the boiled macaroni for a while if you want the salad to be cold.

Preparation time: 30 minutes
