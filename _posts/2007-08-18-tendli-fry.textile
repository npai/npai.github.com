_gherkin fry_


I simply love this tendli-fry. The speciality of this fry is that the tendli is crushed rather than cut.
This allows the spices to enter the inside and also gives a unique taste as each tendli can be eaten whole.

_Ingredients_

* tendli - about 15
* Chilli powder - 1 teaspoon
* Salt to taste
* Oil for frying

_Method_

* Crush each of the tendli with a small weight (crusher) so that the tendli is flattened out and breaks.
* Now add salt and set aside for 2 minutes. Now squeeze the gherkins to get rid of the excess salt water.
* Add chilli powder to taste and spread evenly.
* Shallow fry on a tava with generous quantity of oil on a very low flame. Tendli takes a little longer to cook compared to most of the other vegetables. Serve with daal and rice.
