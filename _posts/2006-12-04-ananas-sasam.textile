_pineapple sidedish_

This sasam has a sweet-sour taste and I absolutely love it. It is one more of the typical konkani dishes. Aambya sasam is made with mangoes, ananas-aambya sasam is made with a combination of mangoes and pineapple. Here I have used only pineapple, hence ananas sasam.

_Ingredients_
* Pineapple cut into small pieces - 1 cup
* Grated coconut - 1 cup
* Red chillies - 4 to 5
* A pinch of tamarind
* A little jaggery
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* Grind the coconut, chillies, tamarind and jaggery with a little water (to the consistency of chutney)
* Now add salt to taste and the pineapple. (If the pineapple is very sour, add more jaggery)
* Serve chilled with rice and curry.

Preparation time: 10 minutes 

Grapes (both white and black) can be added to enhance taste and colour. Green chillies can also be used in place of red chillies. In that case, add sugar instead of jaggery.
