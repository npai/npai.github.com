*Buttermilk gravy*

There are different versions of buttermilk kaDis that are part of the konkani cuisine. This one has garlic in it and it doesnt require any cooking. I recently made this and the 6 year old loved it. So it is another addition to week night, kid-friendly dinners these days. It gets ready in just 5 minutes. I usually dont make buttermilk, so I take some yogurt, mix it well and dilute with enough water.
