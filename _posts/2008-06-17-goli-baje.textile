Also known as mangaLooru bajji. This is a very very tasty and easy to make bajji. Prepare it on a cold evening or when its raining and serve with pipng hot tea.. yummy !!!!

As with other bajji/pakoras there is no need to chop onions etc and hence this is easy to make.

_Ingredients_

* Maida (all purpose flour) - 1 cup
* Gram flour (besan)- 2 tablespoons
* Sour curd - about half cup
* Ginger
* Green chillies - 2 
* Curry leaves
* Oil to fry
* A pinch of baking soda
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* Chop green chillies, ginger and curry leaves into fine pieces (use the quantities and proportion to suit individual taste)
* Add the flours, salt and make into a thick batter-like thing using curds. If you have enough curds at home, do not add any water to the batter. Use curds alone. (The batter should be a little thicker than idly-flour consistency)
* Add a pinch of baking powder.
* Heat oil in a kadai and make bajjis by deep frying small amounts of the batter.
* Drain excess oil on tissue paper and enjoy the bajjis.

Preparation time: 20 minutes
