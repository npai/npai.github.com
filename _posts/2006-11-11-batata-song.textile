_potato sidedish_


I was tired of having the usual idli,dosa, chapatis for breakfast.
While I was trying to think out of the box, I remembered about the hot and sour batata song which my mom makes. It goes very well with chapatis,puris and even bread. It is very easy to make and all the ingredients required to make it will almost always be available in anybody's kitchen. But I still wonder why it got the name 'song' though. As far as I know there is no special meaning to the name in konkani.
