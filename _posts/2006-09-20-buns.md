I had forgotten about buns for a long time. Then I made it last week and again today morning. Buns resemble puris, are very fluffy, a little sweet and is very easy to prepare for breakfast/evening snacks.....Just prepare the dough in the night, allow it to ferment overnight and make puris out of it in the morning.  I made ginger chutney to go with it and I shall write about it in a separate post.
