_cabbage pakoras_

I have been MIA for a long time now. Want to regularly post new recipes again. This weekend it was raining all the time. So I was in the mood for this spicy cabbage baje and piping hot tea.

_Ingredients_

* Finely shredded cabbage - 1 cup
* 1 onion cut into small pieces
* green chillies - 4 to 5
* ginger - 1 inch (grated)
* cilantro chopped (to taste)
* salt to taste
* Red Chilli powder (to taste)
* gram flour (besan) - about half cup
* oil to deep fry


_Method_

* Heat some oil in a kadai. In the meantime chop all the veggies.
* In a bowl take all the chopped veggies, add salt and chilli powder and mix well. When onions come in contact with salt, it leaves some water.
* Add besan to this and mix well. Add few drops of water to hold the veggies and besan together.
* Take very small amounts of this thick mixture and deep fry in oil. In general these bajjis are irregularly shaped. Fry on medium flame till they start turning golden. 
* Serve as a snack with Ketchup or as a sidedish with rice and daal.

Preparation time: 15 minutes
