_gherkin stir-fry_

Gherkin is called tenDli in Konkani and tonDekaayi in kannada.
taLasaNi is a kind of konkani stir fry. See <a href="http://www.konkanirecipes.com/recipes/cabbage-upkari" title="cabbage upkari">cabbage upkari</a>.taLasaNi tastes best if  coconut oil is used as it imparts a very nice flavour. However coconut oil is not a must and any other cooking oil is also good enough.

_Ingredients_

* tendli ( cut into long pieces) - 2 cups
* Mustard
* Chilli powder - 3 teaspoons
* Oil
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* Apply some salt to the tendli pieces and set aside for an hour. This is done to reduce the cooking time of tendli. The same can be done while preparing any other tendli dishes.
* In a kadai, heat 4 teaspoons of oil and add a teaspoon of mustard.
* After it stops sputtering add the tendli pieces and about 3 teaspoons of chilli powder and stir well.
* Keep the kadai on a low flame, cover it with a lid and keep stirring every few minutes till the tendli is completely cooked. If required, add more oil in between or very little (about 2 spoons)water.

The taLasaNi gets its unique flavour because no water is added and is cooked on a low flame with plenty of chilli powder :)

Serve with rice and daal.

Preparation time: 30 minutes
