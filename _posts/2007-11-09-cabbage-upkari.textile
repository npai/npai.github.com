_cabbage stir-fry_

There are 2 types of Konkani stir-fries. One is 'upkari' and the other is 'taLasaNi'.Coconut is added to upkari and also some water is added to it while cooking. On the other hand, taLasaNi is more spicy, is cooked on very low flame with more oil and no coconut is added. Upkari is typically a very common item in everyday meals.
