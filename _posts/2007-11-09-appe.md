_appe / paddu_

Appe (paDDu in Kannada) is a very popular south indian breakfast item. The basic ingredient is rice and the proportion of other ingredients varies. I have written my MIL's recipe here. A special tava is available to make this appe. The best one is the traditional cast-iron thick, black and heavy tava. (the one I have shown in the picture). Care should be taken to grease the tava properly or the paDDus are going to stick to the tava.

_Ingredients_

* Rice - 2 cups
* Urad daal - half cup
* Channa daal - half cup
* Oil
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* Soak the rice and daals for a couple of hours and grind to a smooth batter (little thicker than dosa batter)
* Add salt and let the batter stand overnight.
* In the morning make paDDus out of it. Fry on medium or low flame and use oil generously, otherwise the paDDus will be sticking to the tava.

_Tips_

You can also add ginger, green chillies and coriander leaves to the batter just before making the paDDus to make it tastier and more colourful.
