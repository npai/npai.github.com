_Chutney powder_

chutney pitto is a must in all konkani households. It can be used like a pickle along with food, with idly-dosas, with bread and ofcourse comes in very handy when you dont have the time/patience to grind chutney. I know about 4 varities of chutney piTTo that my mother makes and the one which I have written here about is the most common one and my favourite. So here goes.

_Ingredients_

* 1 coconut - finely grated
* Hurigadale (putani, dalia split) - 100 gm (about 2 cups)
* Red chillies - a big handful 
* Tamarind - the size of a small lemon
* Curry leaves - one cup
* Asafoetida - to taste
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* Use a thick bottomed pan for this purpose.
* On a low flame, roast the grated coconut till it starts turning golden brown. Now transfer this to a separate plate. 
* Similarly roast the other ingredients till it gives out a nice aroma (for about 10 mins). 
* Let all the ingredients cool. Now grind to a  smooth powder. 
* Add salt to taste and store in an air-tight container. 


The proportion of the ingredients can be varied according to individual taste. I prefer more curry leaves and more asafoetida.

Preparation time: 30 minutes
