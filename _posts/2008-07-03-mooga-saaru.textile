_moong curry_

This mooga saaru is an easy to make, simple, tasty, wholesome saaru made of full moong. I guess most people would know about this saaru but I thought of posting it anyways as I love it and make it very often. The lovely aroma of garlic seasoned that goes into this dish makes me drool...
