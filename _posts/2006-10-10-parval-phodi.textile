_parval sidedish_


I am very fond of parvals... I was not able to get the English name for this. Parvals look like gherkins/tenDli but are much bigger and have a thicker skin. Also, they taste like phagil... another vegetable very popular among the konkanis. I have not tried any other sidedish with this parval but I simply love this simple fry.
