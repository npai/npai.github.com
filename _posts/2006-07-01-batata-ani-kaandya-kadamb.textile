_Ingredients_

* 2 potatoes
* 2 onions
* Grated coconut - 1 cup
* Tamarind - small piece
* Red chillies - 7 to 8
* Salt to taste

_Method_

* Cut onion and potato into small pieces and set aside.
* Grind coconut, tamarind and red chillies like a chutney.
* In a thick bottom pan, take the onion potato pieces, to this add the ground mixture and salt to taste.
* Add a little water, cover the pan and cook on a small flame for about 20 minutes till the vegetables boil and the water evaporates.

_Tips_
If a banana leaf is covered on the pan, it adds to the flavour and tastes much better.
