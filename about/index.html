<p>My name is Nayanatara.</p>
<p>
    I am from a beautiful place called

        title="Honavar"
        >Honavar</a

    on the West Coast of India, Karnataka state, Uttar Kannada district.

    In this blog, I want to write mainly about Konkani food which is
    characteristic to the Uttar Kannada district ... Honavar, Kumta, Karwar,
    Ankola.
</p>
<p>
    I attribute all the konkani recipes here to my mother. Amma always makes
    mouth-watering dark-red coloured authentic konkani veg and non-veg dishes. I
    have never come across a better cook than her.

<p>
    Cooking is one of my hobbies and I love to try out different recipes and
    mix/match/carve out my own variations. My hubby
    <a href="http://www.btbytes.com" title="Pradeep">Pradeep</a> is the guinea
    pig for all my creativity :) He is the person who encouraged me to put up
    this website and took care of all the technical stuff. Both of us are
    software engineers based out of Bangalore but currently live in
    Indianapolis.
