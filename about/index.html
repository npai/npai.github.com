title: About Konkanirecipes.com

My name is Nayantara. 

I am from a beautiful place called <a href="http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/karavali/honavar/index.htm" title="Honavar">Honavar</a> on the West Coast of India, Karnataka state, Uttar Kannada district. 

In this blog, I want to write mainly about Konkani food which is characteristic to the Uttar Kannada district ... Honavar, Kumta, Karwar, Ankola. 

I attribute all the konkani recipes here to my mother. Amma always makes mouth-watering dark-red coloured authentic konkani veg and non-veg dishes. I have never come across a better cook than her.

Cooking is one of my hobbies and I love to try out different recipes and mix/match/carve out my own variations. My hubby <a href="http://www.btbytes.com" title="Pradeep">Pradeep</a> is the guinea pig for all my creativity :) He is the person who encouraged me to put up this website and took care of all the technical stuff. Both of us are software engineers based out of Bangalore but currently live in Indianapolis.
